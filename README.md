The ESLint TSC meets every other week to discuss issues related to the project. This repository contains the meeting notes along with other related information.

Meetings are scheduled through issues on this repository. Agenda items may be added by adding the "tsc agenda" label to an issue in the [ESLint repository](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) or any other repository in the organization. If there is no issue, agenda items may also be added by leaving a comment on the issue for a specific meeting in this repository.

All meetings take place in https://gitter.im/eslint/tsc-meetings/
