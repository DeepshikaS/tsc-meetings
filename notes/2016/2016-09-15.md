## Topics

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/7129

* Currently, `escope` does not traverse into Flow or TypeScript type annotations.
* Now that these node types are [standardized for ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/extensions/type-annotations.md), we can include them in the traversal.
* This would be a major-version change, as changing the traversal depth could have unintended side effects on core or custom rules.
* Would not affect code that does not use type annotations.
* Proposal expanded to include [decorators](https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/experimental/decorators.md).
* :+1: from @ilyavolodin, @btmills, @mysticatea

**Resolution**: v4.0 will add traversals for type annotations and decorators.

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6980

* There is a proposal to autofix the `no-tabs` rule. I [@nzakas] believe there is no good way to do this because the rule doesn't know what the correct fix is in this case (it's only disallowing something). The proposal is to use a mixture of inserted spaces and/or removing tabs without replacement depending on location.
* Should we do autofix for `no-tabs`?
* :-1: from @ilyavolodin, @btmills. No objections to not autofixing.

**Resolution**: We will not add autofix to `no-tabs`.

### Check-in on merging pull requests

* Are people feeling more comfortable merging?
* Has the shift to not require issues caused any new problems?
* Some PRs with issues and some without is making for a somewhat confusing transition.
* GitHub Desktop does not suppor the issue template.

**Resolution**: Check in again at the next meeting after we've had more time to transition.
