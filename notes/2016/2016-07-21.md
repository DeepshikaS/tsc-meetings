* Gyandeep Singh (@gyandeeps) - TSC
* Toru Nagashima (@mysticatea) - TSC
* Alberto RodrÃ­guez (@alberto) - TSC

## Administrative Items

* We are not going to discuss implementation details in the TSC meeting.  
Rather, we will discuss high-level ideas and leave those discussions for issues on the repo.
* We will have a hard stop of 90 minutes (60 minute target next meeting).


## Topics

### Nomination of @platinumazure and @vitorbal to be committers

* Nominated by @nzakas
* They've both done a lot of work and have been important in getting issues triaged quickly
* Seconded by @ilyavolodin, +1 from @gyandeeps, @btmills, @alberto, @mysticatea

**Resolution**
@platinumazure & @vitorbal will be added as committers following the TSC meeting.


### Support having plugins as dependencies in shareable config ([issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458))

* Issue is a request to allow shareable configs to include dependencies directly.
* In general is a good idea, but hard to implement
* Requires more thought on possible solutions

**Resolution**
We will restart the conversation on the issue thread and try to find a technical solution there.


### Indent rule

* `Indent` has the largest number of open issues of any rule (currently 15, oldest is > 1 year old).
* No work seems to be being done on the rule
* @BYK and @gyandeeps have the most knowledge about it, and have both rewritten or started to rewrite it.

**Resolution**
1.  @ilyavolodin will coordinate improvement of the rule, which means organizing issues, deciding on options, and architecting a high-level design strategy for the rule.  He will start by creating an issue to summarize open issues.
2.  @gyandeeps & @mysticatea will work to close some of the existing issues after @ilyavolodin curates the current list.


### What ES6 features do we want to introduce and how?

**Resolution**
We will continue discussing this on https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6407


### Should we have a policy for major releases?

* This was discussed in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6629

**Resolution**
This was resolved in the issue.  There was not enough interest to proceed.


### Should we try to sketch a roadmap?

* https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/5040
* We've tried to make a roadmap in the past, but so far they have not worked out well as a guide for next steps.

**Resolution**
@ilyavolodin will open an issue in the ESLint repo that is locked to ESLint team members to
discuss where we would like the project to go in the future.


### Reevaluate global vs. local installation of ESLint/plugins

**Resolution**
@ilyavolodin will open an issue to discuss this.


### How we can make more progress on JSCS compatibility

* We have a bunch of JSCS compatibility issues open that we have said are the top priority,
but there's not a lot of movement on them (aside from @mysticatea).
* We've closed 8 issues and there are 31 issues outstanding
* 22 of the issues are not marked as "accepted", and have not had much discussion.

**Resolution**
1. The team agrees to review the issues not marked as "accepted" and discuss/accept them as appropriate.
2. The following issues are agreed to immediately be marked as "accepted"
    - [`no-tabs`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6079)
    - [`func-name-matching`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6065)
    - [`no-spaced-func`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6080)
    - [`prefer-numeric-literals`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6068)
    - [`sort-keys`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6076)
