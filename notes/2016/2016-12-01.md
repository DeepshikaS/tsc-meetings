## Topics

### [December 9, 2016 release](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/7659)

**Resolution**: @kaicataldo will run the release, and @btmills will second.

### [no-return-await complex return argument](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/7594)

* Right now, `no-return-await` only catches cases where the `AwaitExpression` is the immediate child of the `ReturnStatement` like `return await expr;` but not more complex cases like `return a ? await b : c;`.
* TSC Question: Should we accept this enhancement?
* It doesn't make sense to keep more thorough checking behind an option, so we either do it by default or not at all.
* @btmills, @ilyavolodin, @kaicataldo, @alberto in favor of accepting the change
* @ilyavolodin, @kaicataldo, @btmills, @alberto in favor of the change being a semver-minor enhancement

**Resolution**: We will accept the issue as an enhancement.

### [Support IntelliJ-style alignment in key-spacing](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/7661)

* This deals with the way property grouping works in `key-spacing`. Right now, our algorithm does not support IntelliJ's preferred alignment.
* A [previous issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2668) for this had an accepted proposal, but was closed after nobody worked on it.

**Resolution**: @btmills will write up a more thorough description on the issue.

### [Can we ship new APIs separate from a rewrite of API docs?](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/7669)

* @ilyavolodin is working on adding new APIs per [#6256](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6256).
* Many of our APIs are missing documentation, so a rewrite is in progress.
* Do we need to delay the PR with the new APIs until after the docs are improved?
* @kaicataldo, @btmills, @alberto in favor of allowing docs improvements after adding the new APIs.

**Resolution**: Docs improvements do not need to block the PR with the new APIs.
