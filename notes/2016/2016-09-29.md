## Topics

### Nomination of @not-an-aardvark as a committer

**Resolution**: @not-an-aardvark will be added as a committer following the meeting!

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6525

* This is a proposal to add additional API methods to core

**Resolution**: Issue is accepted and should be added to the Core Roadmap

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6592, https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6874, https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6740

* These are accepted issues for core
* Seems to be a point of confusion - accepted core issues should end up on the roadmap
* `Help wanted` issues should not be added to the core roadmap because we're not committed to doing them ourselves

**Resolution**: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6740 should have the `help wanted` label removed and all three issues should be added to the Core Roadmap

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/7038 Postmortem

* There was confusion surrounding the subsequent patch releases to the minor release on Sep 23, 2016
* Patch was released on Monday that fixed one of three regressions, leaving two unfixed regressions
* A semver-minor PR was merged the next day, making the next release a minor version bump instead of a patch
* A `regression` label could make finding and fixing regression issues easier
* We need some guidance around patch releases, both the initial one on the following Monday and any necessary subsequent patches

**Resolution**: Create a `regression` label as well as open an issue to discuss the following:
* Come up with guidance around when on Monday patch releases should be made.
* Come up with guidance around when a Tuesday patch release should be made.
* How to notify the team when we are in "possible patch release" mode to avoid merging things.
* What is the proper course of action if a semver-minor PR has been mistakenly merged - should we do a minor release?

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/5900

* Issue is accepted and in the Core Roadmap, but has the `help wanted` label

**Resolution**: Remove `help wanted` label to match our new guidelines for what issues should be in the Core Roadmap.

### Release on September 30, 2016

**Resolution**: @nzakas and @kaicataldo will handle this release

### Release on October 14, 2016

**Resolution**: @mysticatea and @btmills will handle this release

### Review pull requests without issues are going

* Pros: Lots more PRs! Cons: Open PRs are stagnating, difficult to tell the status of open PRs
* External contributing factors: team members are currently less active, larger volume of incoming PRs
* Other concerns: current PR template is complex, currently can't filter/search by review status

**Resolution**: Label PRs the same way we do issues, continue discussion next meeting
