## Topics

### [Add CLI option to report unused eslint-disable directives](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9249)

* TSC Summary: This issue proposes adding a CLI flag to report unused eslint-disable directives.
* TSC Question: Should we accept this issue?
* Add it with a CLI flag for now and figure out how to better support editor integrations in the future.
* 👍 from @mysticatea, @btmills, @not-an-aardvark, @gyandeeps, @kaicataldo. @ilyavolodin was impartial.

**Resolution**: This issue is now accepted.

### [support else if in no-else-return](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9229)

* TSC Summary: This PR updates no-else-return to also report else if statements, if the preceding if statement always uses return. Previously, the rule was not checking this case.
* TSC Question: How should we introduce this change? There is some concern about potential breakage and user confusion if we update the default behavior rather than putting the updated behavior behind an option.
* This seems like a missed case for this rule.
* 👍 from all attending TSC members.

**Resolution**: Since it will result in an increase in errors, the decision is to put this behind a configuration flag and revisit whether we should make this the default behavior in a future major release.

### [Proposal: defer rule listener calls until after traversal is complete](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9122)

* TSC Summary: This issue proposes updating traversal logic to call rule listeners after all nodes have a parent property. This is intended to prevent rules from having confusing issues where only some nodes have a parent property. There is no compatibility impact, and based on an implementation locally, there is no noticeable performance impact.
* TSC Question: Should we accept this proposal?
* 👍 from all attending TSC members.

**Resolution**: This issue is now accepted.

### [Update: allow autofixing when using processors](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9090)

* TSC Summary: This issue proposes allowing autofixing to occur when using processors, by having processors modify autofix locations as necessary as part of the postprocess method.
* TSC Question: Should we accept this proposal? If so, should we make this available to processors by default, or add an opt-in for a processor to declare that it supports autofixing?
* 👍 from all attending TSC members.

**Resolution**: This issue is now accepted.

### [eslint-visitor-keys package](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/issues/58#issuecomment-328612081)

* TSC Question:
> I'd like to propose that @mysticatea's proposal here: eslint/eslint#8755 (comment)
...for a new eslint-visitor-keys package is discussed at the meeting.
> We are trying to find an optimal solution to improving parser integrations and this would seem like a good way to proceed.
* 👍 from all attending TSC members.

**Resolution**: Consensus is that we're not opposed to creating a new repo under the org, though we should make an issue to hammer out the details of what that new repo and package actually contain.
