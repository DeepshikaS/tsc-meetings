## Topics

### Nominating @not-an-aardvark to the TSC

**Resolution:**  

@not-an-aardvark is the newest member of the ESLint TSC. Welcome!

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/7991

* We have a lot of categories, which can be a source of confusion.
* The proposal is to have fewer categories and to use tags to label/filter rules.

**Resolution:**  

This issue is now accepted and actual implementation will be fleshed out in the discussion for the issue.

### https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/7841

* This PR proposes a fixer for no-unused-labels, which could get in the way if people are running autofixers on unfinished code (e.g. editor integration)
* We have other rules that already do this

**Resolution:**  

1. Accept this proposal  
2. Create a new issue to discuss how we can do per-rule autofixing
